 <title>A Community Oriented Dental Office</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We opened our dental office on Main Street in Nazareth, many years ago. It was easy at that time to be seen as a community oriented dental office. We were right on Main Street across from the &quot;Y&quot;. After we moved out to Route 248, that feeling of being part of our community began to erode. Let&#039;s face it. We were out in the country. (It&#039;s not country anymore! Think Wegman&#039;s, Sheetz, etc.) We got lots of new patients, but it was not because we were part of our community. It was because of all kinds of other reasons. They got referrals from satisfied patients, they heard we made good crowns or dentures, they liked our parking lot, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/blog/large_Sorting%20Food%20Bank.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sorting Food&quot; title=&quot;Sorting Food&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;Â A somber moment as we pack a shipment of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost our roots, and that was not a good thing. So we&#039;ve been doing a number of things to reconnect with the Nazareth area. One of the latest projects was to have a food drive for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nazarethareafoodbank.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Nazareth Area Food Bank&quot;&gt;Nazareth Area Food Bank&lt;/a&gt;. It was tied to some big discounts on our exams and x-rays. The drive was quite successful. We collected almost 700 items of food for the bank. It was a win-win-win-win situation. People who were in desperate need got food, the Food Bank got wider exposure, we were able to strengthen our ties to the Nazareth area, and people who never heard of us got some great dental care. Now that&#039;s a good deal!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/community&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/nazareth-area-food-bank&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nazareth Area Food Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
