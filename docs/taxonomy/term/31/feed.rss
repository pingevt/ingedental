 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Is snoring bothering you?&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; height=&quot;109&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/blog/8/Snoring_1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Is snoring bothering you?&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;Recently we were working with a man with severe snoring problems. His snoring was so loud he and his wife had resorted to sleeping in separate bedrooms. As he realized his treatment was likely to be successful, he agreed to follow through with it under one condition. We were not to tell his wife he had stopped snoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he had gotten to like sleeping in separate bed rooms. He could make as much of a mess as he liked without being nagged to straighten things up. Another big benefit was that there were no more fights over the TV remote. Living in separate bedrooms was actually helping their marriage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things to know about snoring:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snoring is often related to sleep apnea. Snoring is caused by a flap of tissue at the back of the throat fluttering up and down, narrowing the airway. When the airway gets too narrow, it can block the flow of air almost completely. The sleeping person can actually stop breathing for a few seconds or longer. It can happen many times throughout the night. This causes a sleep disturbance, often to the point of causing the person to wake up. The technical name for this is obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA. It is associated with a multitude of problems, including even death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dentistry has long been associated just with fillings, dentures, crown and bridge, cleanings, etc. Now it is a vital partner with physicians and technicians in the area of sleep medicine, or specifically, sleep dentistry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loud snoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced resistance to infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choking or Gasping for breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our next blog we will discuss this dangerous condition a bit further. With so many people out there who are affected by it, many without even knowing it, sleep apnea is an important topic. It is associated with many dangerous conditions. Knowledge and treatment of it can truly be a life saver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/snoring&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;snoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/sleep-apnea&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/osa&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;OSA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/obstructive-sleep-apnea&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
