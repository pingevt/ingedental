 <title>HELP OUR DENTAL OFFICE MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</title>
 <link>http://ingedental.com/blog/help-our-dental-office-make-difference</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-blog_full_width&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/styles/blog_full_width/public/blog/arc_combined.png?itok=K36AQPH8&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;246&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the weeks ahead, we are going to be raising support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcoflehighnorthampton.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Arc of Lehigh and Northampton Counties&lt;/a&gt;. The Arc educates and provides services and support to more than 1500 children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families across the greater Lehigh Valley EACH YEAR. There was a time not too long ago when doctors told their parents that the best place for their child was in an institution. It was from the stubborn refusal to accept that institutionalization was the only option that The Arc was born. Our dental office is having a special to help support this great organization. Here are some items that The Arc can use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arts and Crafts Supplies (no crayons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bath Towels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookie Sheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash Cloths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muffin Tins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packs of Adult Underwear (men&#039;s and women&#039;s--any size)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake Pans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tea Towels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone bringing in three of these items or a donation of $20 or more (tax deductible) gets a cleaning, exam, and regular x-rays for just $99 - a saving of $80!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/community&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>CONGRATULATIONS IMOGENE!</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Imogene Kresge receives ipad&quot; class=&quot;float-left&quot; src=&quot;/sites/default/files/styles/blog_third_width/public/blog/FullSizeRender.jpg?itok=2Wmv9Quh&quot; title=&quot;Imogene Kresge receives ipad&quot; width=&quot;193&quot; height=&quot;257&quot; /&gt;We have been raising support for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dreamcometrue.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dream Come True&lt;/a&gt; for several months now. Dream Come True is one of those organizations that really make a difference in this world. They help children with chronic or terminal disease make their wildest dream come true. Our dental office held a drawing for an iPad Mini to help Dream Come True send a great little guy to The Magic Kingdom at Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we announced the winner of our drawing—Imogene Kresge! This is an unplanned, but fortunate, turn of events because Imogene works for an organization which has recently sent two children and their families to Disney World through Dream Come True. It’s called “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcoflehighnorthampton.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Arc of Lehigh and Northampton Counties&lt;/a&gt;”.  It provides services and support for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. You’ll be hearing a lot more about them later. In the meantime we need to find someone who can teach Imogene how to use her iPad Mini. She says she knows how to turn it on, but that’s about it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/community&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>A Community Oriented Dental Office</title>
 <link>http://ingedental.com/blog/community-oriented-dental-office</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We opened our dental office on Main Street in Nazareth, many years ago. It was easy at that time to be seen as a community oriented dental office. We were right on Main Street across from the &quot;Y&quot;. After we moved out to Route 248, that feeling of being part of our community began to erode. Let&#039;s face it. We were out in the country. (It&#039;s not country anymore! Think Wegman&#039;s, Sheetz, etc.) We got lots of new patients, but it was not because we were part of our community. It was because of all kinds of other reasons. They got referrals from satisfied patients, they heard we made good crowns or dentures, they liked our parking lot, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/default/files/blog/large_Sorting%20Food%20Bank.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sorting Food&quot; title=&quot;Sorting Food&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt; A somber moment as we pack a shipment of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We lost our roots, and that was not a good thing. So we&#039;ve been doing a number of things to reconnect with the Nazareth area. One of the latest projects was to have a food drive for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nazarethareafoodbank.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Nazareth Area Food Bank&quot;&gt;Nazareth Area Food Bank&lt;/a&gt;. It was tied to some big discounts on our exams and x-rays. The drive was quite successful. We collected almost 700 items of food for the bank. It was a win-win-win-win situation. People who were in desperate need got food, the Food Bank got wider exposure, we were able to strengthen our ties to the Nazareth area, and people who never heard of us got some great dental care. Now that&#039;s a good deal!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/community&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/tags/nazareth-area-food-bank&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Nazareth Area Food Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
